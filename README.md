Their passwords themselves must be strong enough to withstand even the most rigorous of attacks. HashMob wants to provide a platform for users to collaborate together so that password research can be improved upon and trends can be discovered. We aggregate data and publish statistics, wordlists, rules, resources, tutorials, guides, and other things that researchers and penetration testers can use to further improve themselves
